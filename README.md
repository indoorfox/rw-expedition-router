# rw-expedition-router
A tool for routing from one location to another in Rain World.

Currently expects all `world_[region abbreviation].txt` files to be in the same directory as main.py.
Cannot presently read modify files (and therefore does not interpret MSC changes).
Currently uses a pre-set list of weights.
